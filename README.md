# spotify-web-api-project
Using Spotify's Web API to compare this 2021 Season's "Christmas Classics" and "New Music Holiday".

**Objective: What similarities or differences can we see between these playlists from Spotify's given audio features from their web API?** 

Personal Goals: 

* Quick Project: 2 days of learning to work with reference from Steven Morse's article (noted below), Spotify Web API documentation, and distill a specific goal with given parameters. 
* Explore new tech: First time working with a Web API for a data-focused project using python and jupyterlabs. Realizing new sources of data manipulation with JSON. 
* Be Personal: The project intersects a love and background for music as an ex-viola player. As well as a chance to take advantage of the holiday season to view songs that are being replayed constantly.
